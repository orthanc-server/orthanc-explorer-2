Pending changes
===============


Changes:
- added multi-language support

0.4.3 (2022-11-03)
==================

Changes:

  'ViewersOrdering' and 'ViewersIcons'.  The default configuration is identical to the 0.4.1 behaviour.
- adapted orthanc-share API

0.4.2 (2022-10-28)
==================

Changes:
- implement study sharing UI for orthanc-share project (still confidential, will be presented at OrthancCon 2022)

0.4.0 (2022-08-30)
==================

Changes:
- new simplified interface to query DICOM modalities and retrieve study.
  It does not allow yet browsing distant series/instances.  Still a work in progress !
- show C-Echo status of DICOM modalities.
- allow controling wildcards in text search to implement exact or partial match.
  The default remains a partial match -> if you enter a `filterValue` text in a filter,
  Orthanc will search for `*filterValue*`.  By adding a `"` at the beginning or at the end of the text, you force an exact match at the beggining or at the end of the text.
